# All the flavors of mental break

When your mentale state reaches 0, your character completely loses their composure and must act accordingly to their
Mental break rules.

Mental break rules also apply to ennemies.

The rules can vary from developing a grudge, becoming embarrassed and fleeing the situation, frothing rage against the
one who wronged you or other outbursts of built-up stress. You can either pitch your own mental break rules or roll them
on a table.

| Mental Break Type            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1- **Fury**                  | Your charisma, intellect and sense drop by 2 and your strength, toughness & speed increase by 2 until you regain your mental state. You attack the person who insulted you.                             |
| 2- **Choice**                | The DM offers you 2 actions. You choose which one you take. You gain 2 Force on the next roll you make.                                                                                                 |
| 3- **Misery**                | All attributes are lowered by 1 until you can spend a sufficient amount of time brooding in peace.                                                                                                      |
| 4- **Joy**                   | You become strangely jovial and happy. You cannot take violent actions. Your charisma increases by 3 until you regain your mental state by spending a sufficient amount of time laughing your guts out. |
| 5- **Hollow**                | You cannot act. You become immune to illusions and dodge rolls gain 5 Force. This state ends once a sufficient amount of time passes or when a friend snaps you out of it.                              |
| 6- **Explode**               | Your Qi goes out of control and concentrates in a single limb. Roll a d4. The limb shatters and a 15ft explosion with a force equal to your Qi ruptures from it.                                        |
| 7- **Manifestation**         | Manifestation of a demon: Your worst sin takes you over (think seven deadly sins) and you are compelled to act according to it.                                                                         |
| 8- **Rupturing cultivation** | Rupturing cultivation: You immediately use a technique from your cultivation method. First you choose a technique. Then the DM chooses who or what you target.                                          |
