# All the flavors of mental break

When your mentale state reaches 0, your character completely loses their composure and must act accordingly to their Mental
break rules.

Mental break rules also apply to ennemies.

The rules can vary from developing a grudge, becoming embarrassed and fleeing the situation, frothing rage against the one
who wronged you or other outbursts of built-up stress. You can either pitch your own mental break rules or roll them on a
table.
