# The universal force system

Dice. The players roll dice to determine success or failure of actions.

An ability check is done by comparing the results of dice to a static value or the value of an opposed roll. In this game
each thing has **FORCE**. 

**FORCE** means the number of dice a thing has which opposes an attempt. For example, lifting a
rock the size of a horse is a task with a static FORCE of 20. This means that an attempt to lift this rock must have 20 
FORCE or more to succeed.

Everything you do revolves around this.

:::tip Optional rule
During gameplay you may suggest that instead of outright failing a check you ask for the DM to allow you to succeed with
a price such as hurting yourself or exposing yourself to danger.
:::

:::note Spend QI
During gameplay you may spend before making a roll. Spending qi adds FORCE to your roll equal to the amount of qi spent
(You spend 3 qi you roll 3 extra dice). During combat, you may also spend qi to extend your movement if you are on a map.
Your movement increases by 1 square for each point of qi spent.
