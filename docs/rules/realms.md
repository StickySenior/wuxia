# Classification of realms

## Cultivation, Training and ranks

Cultivation is the art of refining chi within your body to temper your mind, body and soul.

To cultivate, one must practice a cultivation method and follow its instructions. During gameplay a character can
cultivate when they set aside time for it or when the criteria for cultivation is met during gameplay such as the
Ironheart flagbearers method where the user cultivates by stubbornly surviving harrowing combat in the field of battle.

By cultivating you gain an amount of FORCE determined by story elements in play. The FORCE can be used to break through
a wall in your method and increase the RANK of your cultivation method.

Training martial arts works the same, but it’s much less restrictive. You gain force to breakthrough a martial art by
using it in combat and practicing it during free time. You may also gain force to it by getting instructions from a
practitioner of a similar art or by studying its history.

Cultivation methods and martial arts can be forgotten and replaced if the user wishes. However, removing a cultivation
method from your body is no easy task. To remove it you must pass through an ability check that’s FORCE is equal to all
of the walls FORCES which you have broken through combined.

Forgetting a martial art is easy. You just stop practicing it and forget it lol.

## Ranks and upgrades

### List of ranks

Realms or ranks is what determines, as a cultivator, the dice you roll for your ability checks. The list goes as
follows:

1. Mortal realm - **D2**
2. Martial arts realm - **D4**
3. Chi gathering realm - **D6**
4. Foundation forming - **D8**
5. Foundation establishment - **D10**
6. Core formation - **D12**
7. Nascent soul - **D14**
8. Immortal - **D16**
9. Sage Immortal - **D20**
10. God - **D100**

To advance in these Ranks you must venture out and experience life with all of its highs and lows. Great battles,
victories, and losses.

### Raising your ranks

Completing adventures and reaching story milestones gives you FORCE to use against the wall difficulty of each rank. (
The DM may also simply state that the player or players advance to the following rank to decrease the workload of
watching after the FORCE). The wall difficulty of each rank is a static value which you must beat. Failing to beat it
doesn't mean you lose force. You may retry after a while of rest or when you have gathered more assistance and
resources.

| Ranks               | Mortal | Martial arts | Chi Gathering | Foundation forming | Foundation Establishment | Gloden Core | Nascent Soul | Immortal | Sage Immortal | God  |
