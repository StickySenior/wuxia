# Character creation & character sheet

## Ability Scores

- **Body:**
   - Your physical body. Bones, meat, skin, nerves, organs and blood. A strong body is necessary for a warrior. Physical
     strength is really useful in life.
   - Your body score is equal to your STRENGTH and TOUGHNESS combined. _Body = Strength + Toughness_
   - If your body is destroyed you must rely on your mind, soul, and qi reserves to survive as a ghost until you can get/possess
     a new body or become a true ghost cultivator.

- **Mental state:** Your mind.
   - Stability of mind is necessary for a cultivator as your qi and body is controlled with your mind as well as your ability
     to reason.
   - When your mental state drops to 0 you suffer a MENTAL BREAK. During a mental break a player character must act according
     to their mental break rules. These rules are either rolled for or are made up depending on the character.
   - Your mental state is equal to your INTELLECT

- **Soul integrity:**
   - Your soul is your gift from the world upon your birth. The soul is what allows your body to age, grow and eventually die.
   - While your mind is your awareness and understanding of reality, your soul represents your will to live and your ambitions,
     hopes and dreams. Losing your soul is a rare and horrible thing.
   - If you do lose your soul you become a soul devouring zombie. You must rely on your body and intellect as you scramble
     to gather the souls of others to feel something.
   - To escape a feeling worse than suffering in hell. The complete and total numbness that can be experienced by losing a
     soul can make you attempt self-destruction. However, you are eternally stuck in a state of numb awareness incapable of
     progressing away from it. The void claims you.
   - Some do survive by being granted a new soul by the heavens. If one manages to discern the will of the heavens and act
     upon them, serving the universe. The universe might see you as an error and fix you by allowing you to undergo rebirth.
   - Your soul Is equal to your CHARISMA

- **Qi:**
   - Your qi is what all living things have, however you can gather it to accumulate excess qi into your body.
   - Your max QI is equal to the combined value of your two highest ability scores.
   - Qi can be spent to increase the force of ability checks by an amount equal to the qi spent.
