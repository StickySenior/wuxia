# Everything on Cultivation Methods

## Overview

Cultivation methods are a central part of the world‚Äôs history. They allow for specialized and enhanced usage and storing 
of qi. Its practitioners are empowered and changed by these mighty methods.

Practicing cultivation methods allows for the user to gather QI through a specialized way. Without a cultivation method 
you normally need to rely on external sources of QI such as spiritual water or eating some qi infused animal or plant.
Similar to martial arts you need FORCE to break through the walls within your method to acquire abilities. FORCE can be
gained through moments of inspiration, inhumane cruelties which allow for shortcuts, teachings of master‚Äôs or straight up
practice.
