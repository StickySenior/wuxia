# Compendium of Martial arts

## Overview

Martial arts are recorded ways of self-defense and paths of thought. Some are
straightforward ways of striking and blocking and some are profound paths of thought that
strive to enlighten the practitioner.

Practicing martial arts requires you to have sufficient FORCE to break through a wall within
the art. Once you do, you gain the abilities within it. FORCE for martial arts practicing can be
gained through moments of inspiration, teachings from masters and practitioners or simply
practicing the art.

## Nine Petal Lotus arts üå∫

The nine petal lotus art emphasizes speed and defense first. The weapons employed by its
practitioners are either spears, staves or swords.

    - Wall Force ?
    - Higher State: You can spend 1 qi to enter a higher state of being, while grounded and on your turn. This state
ends when you take physical or mental damage, instantly if you are experiencing a mental break, die or willingly end it.
Otherwise, you can stay in this higher state for as long as you want, even through sleep. While in this state you gain
the following benefits: 
        - You can levitate off the ground effortlessly. Your maximum levitation height is based on your intelligence
score with 1 point you can levitate 5 feet off the ground and 2 points meaning you can levitate 10 feet off the ground,
and so on. 
        - You can use your movement to go higher than your intelligence score would normally allow you to (Such as when
crossing a chasm.) However, if you end your turn higher than your maximum levitation height you take one mental damage.
    - Brain Brawn: 
        - When making an unarmed, weapon attack or contest which would normally use your strength score, you can instead
spend one Qi point to use your intelligence score for the attack.

    <TabItem value="Rank 2" label="Rank 2">
    - Wall Force ?
    - +1 Intelligence. 
    - Fortified Mind: 
        - You can now optionally spend more Qi to enter your Higher State. Relatedly your Higher State no longer instantly
ends from taking physical or mental damage (unless you die, knocked out or experience a mental break). Instead, you can
contest the damage. 
        - Roll force equal to the amount of qi you spent on entering your Higher State versus the damage you took. If you
loose you are snapped out from your Higher State and receive the damage as normal. If you win you stay in the Higher
State however you must deduct 1 from the amount of Qi you spent to enter the state and take the damage. If you win while
only having 1 Qi left in your Higher State, you exit the state but do not take damage from the attack.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Rank 3" label="Rank 3" default>
    - Wall Force ?
    - + 1 Speed or Intelligence. 
    - Speed of Though: 
        - While you are in your Higher State you can freely spend 1 qi to change your turn order placement from being
based on your Speed to being based on your Intelligence for this turn. If you spend Qi this way while the current turn 
taker has a lower speed than your intelligence, you take your turn immediately.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Rank 4" label="Rank 4" default>
    - Wall Force ?
    - +1 Intelligence. And +1 to any stat of your choice 
    - Expanded Mind: Choose one of the benefits below.
        - Psychic Screen: 
            - While in your Higher State you can expend Qi to form a glass like spectral psychic screen in an area you
can see. The screen is always as thin as a human hair and square, each Qi expended in its creation makes the screen 5 
feet wider and taller. The Body of the Psychic Screen is equal to your Intelligence score, while its force is equal to
the Qi spent in making it, for rolls the Psychic screen uses dice that are 1 level below yours. (If you use d6 it uses
d4). If you create the Screen inside a creature it must make a dodge against the shield, on a failure it takes damage
and is pushed aside if still alive, otherwise it is dissected by the shield. The Screen cannot recover body and will 
disappear if you lose your Higher State.
        - Versatile Wits: 
            - When you need to use an ability score other than Intelligence, Strength or Speed (For turn placement).
You can spend half of your Intelligence (Rounded down) amount of Qi to use your intelligence score instead of the 
original ability. 
    - Telekinetic Strength: 
        - Your Brain Brawn from rank 1 of this art is enhanced! After expending on Qi you can now do any action which
would require strength with your intelligence score and the range in which you can perform the action is now 15 feet.
