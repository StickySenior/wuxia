# Compendium of Martial arts

## Overview

Martial arts are recorded ways of self-defense and paths of thought. Some are
straightforward ways of striking and blocking and some are profound paths of thought that
strive to enlighten the practitioner.

Practicing martial arts requires you to have sufficient FORCE to break through a wall within
the art. Once you do, you gain the abilities within it. FORCE for martial arts practicing can be
gained through moments of inspiration, teachings from masters and practitioners or simply
practicing the art.

## Nine Petal Lotus arts üå∫

The nine petal lotus art emphasizes speed and defense first. The weapons employed by its
practitioners are either spears, staves or swords.
